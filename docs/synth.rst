Synths
------

Synths are used by the wave channel to define the shape of its waveform and how
that shape changes over time.

A synth is defined by a sequence of 16 waveforms. In LSDJ waveforms can be
drawn by hand, or can be generated by tweaking the softsynth's parameters.

If you update the synth's waves or its parameters, the synth's *wave synth
overwrite lock* in its parent song will be updated appropriately. Modifying the
wave frames manually will enable the lock, while modifying its parameters will
disable the lock.

Usage Examples
==============

.. code-block:: python

   # Get the raw waveforms for synth $3
   waves = song.synths[0x3].waves

   # Get the end volume for synth $9
   vol = song.synths[0x9].end.volume
