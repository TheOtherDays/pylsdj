Synths
------

Synths are used by the wave channel to define the shape of its waveform and how
that shape changes over time.

A synth is defined by a sequence of 16 waveforms. In LSDJ waveforms can be
drawn by hand, or can be generated by tweaking the softsynth's parameters.

Note that waves in pylsdj are **read-only**, since updating parameters will
invalidate the raw waves.

Usage Examples
==============

.. code-block:: python

   # Get the raw waveforms for synth $3
   waves = song.synths[0x3].waves

   # Get the end volume for synth $9
   vol = song.synths[0x9].end.volume
